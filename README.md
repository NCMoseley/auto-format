The Workspace settings are in the .vscode folder, there are a bunch of conflicting packages and configs, I got really lost late last night.

I find if you right click, and select Format Document With... and pick prettier, when its working it will format. but this behavior is inconsistent also. I'm frustrated with this, so for now I leave it in your capable hands haha.
